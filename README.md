# üêº Dominguers

Managing and distributing crypto funds among multiple recipients has always been a cumbersome process, requiring multiple gas-heavy transactions and complex wallet interactions.  Dominguers provides a seamless, gas-free solution for batch distributing crypto funds.

## Description

The crypto ecosystem still faces significant challenges when it comes to efficiently managing and distributing funds across multiple addresses. Traditional methods require users to:

- Execute multiple individual transactions
- Pay gas fees for each transfer
- Manage complex transaction queues

Dominguers solves these pain points by introducing a smart wallet-powered platform that enables users to split and distribute funds in a single batch transaction, completely gas-free. Thanks to our integration with Coinbase's onchainkit, we handle all gas fees, making the experience truly frictionless for our users.

When users land on Dominguers, they can:

- Deposit funds from any source into their smart wallet
- Add multiple recipient addresses through our intuitive interface
- Set custom distribution amounts or percentages
- Execute the split with a single click
- Pay zero gas fees, as we sponsor all transactions

Our platform doesn't just simplify fund distribution‚Äîit transforms it into a seamless experience that anyone can use, regardless of their crypto expertise. Whether you're a DAO treasurer distributing rewards, a project leader paying contributors, or simply splitting costs with friends, Dominguers handles the complexity while you focus on what matters.

This MVP demonstrates how smart wallets and batched transactions can revolutionize fund management in web3, potentially integrating with major DeFi platforms and crypto applications to provide efficient treasury management solutions.
